### Hi, Tesonet,
I accomplished the task to the best of my knowledge and it's up for your judgement now.
### There are several things I'd like to mention:
1. I used MobX instead of Redux, which I'm more familiar with.
2. Login validation is a dummy one, normally it would add a validator to store and show on unsuccessful attempt, but for this task I thought this one would be appropriate.
3. Servers list can be sorted by clicking on 'Servers' and 'Distances' columns (click twice for ascending/descending).
4. In case you forgot credentials are - Login: tesonet ; Password: partyanimal
5. Running the app is simple as always - yarn ==> yarn start

### Thank you
I had fun doing this task and I hope seeing / working with you soon.



Cheers!

Giedrius.

### Testing: Jest-dom + Enzyme

---

To get up and running:

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

Testing:

```
npm test

Used Redux to store user authentication status, make API calls and store fetched data.
Added a couple loading animations and 404 page, but didn't modified anything in provided design. Website seems to be working on IE11 :)
Well prepared task, liked the design, had fun building it 👍

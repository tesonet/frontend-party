# Tesonet FrontEnd developer task

## Basic instructions

1. Fork this repo
1. Grab design files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ql709t4h1ksl8jn/AACaARTQ9wUkpRNj07w2uHRka?dl=0).  
   If you don't have Sketch or Photoshop, there are always free options to preview design:
   - [Avocode](https://avocode.com/) - just import `.sketch` file
   - [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) - just import `.sketch` file
   - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - just import `.sketch` file
1. Do your best with the task üí™
1. Prepare a pull request and let us know that you are done (feel free to add comment a about the task)

## Requirements

### Design

- Design should be recreated as per provided design file. We aren't talking about pixel perfect, we know there are gazillion screen sizes these days, just follow best UI/UX patterns, don't invent new icons, colors or spacing and you're all good! üëç
- Design must be mobile-firendly and responsive.
- Use `SVG`'s where possible
- For `CSS` you can use whatever you need and feel comfortable with (vanilla `CSS` is an option too), but we strongly recommend these:
  - pre-processor ([`SCSS`](https://sass-lang.com/))
  - [`CSS-in-JS`](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#what-is-css-in-js) library ([`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/), [`JSS`](https://cssinjs.org/), [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [`aphrodite`](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite))
  - [`BEM`](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology

### App

- Use ES6+ features where applicable
- Use [`react.js`](https://reactjs.org/)
- Use state management solution ([`redux`](https://redux.js.org/) preferably). We know it is possible to do without, but we are curious - can you do with?
- This must be a single page application. Use routing library([`react-router-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) or [`@reach/router`](https://reach.tech/router))
- Implement login by sending an authorization request (`POST`) to http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/tokens to generate a token (don't forget to pass `Content-Type`):

```json
{ "username": "tesonet", "password": "partyanimal" }
```

- Use browser storage solution to persist token between sessions
- Use the token to retrieve the server list from http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/servers,
- Order the results of servers list by `distance` and `name`.
- Implement logout (don't forget about the token in the storage)
- Your app must work on all modern browsers and IE11+ üê¢ü§∑

### Bonus

- It is all good to use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a starter, but if you have time and want showcase your skill - use JS bundler ([`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) preferred) üì¶üì¶üì¶
- We highly recommend following `TDD` patterns and showcasing your skills at writing tests(`unit`, `integration`, `e2e` - all are good)
- Use [`npm scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for running tasks, i.e. for development, clening build or etc.
- Do validation of login fields and provide user friendly error messages if needed **#UXmatters**
- Indicate loading state for the user whenever requests are in action and user might not understand they needs to wait

## Few tips

- Imagine this as a production level product at scale üòâ
- Structure! With great structure, comes great reusability!
- Maybe You have an idea that is not in the task? Do it! It's on you!
- Have fun! üéâüéâüéâ

<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

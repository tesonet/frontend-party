# FrontEnd developer task

To start a dev server run:
`npm install && npm start`
### Comments
Had a great time doing the task! 

Now I have a deeper knowledge of webpack, babel configurations, also, it is always good to sharpen my redux and styling skills.

Would definetely spend more time on writing more and better tests in the future. Also, I would add a sorting functionality for the servers table as it would benefit the users in real life.

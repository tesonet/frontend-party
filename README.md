# Tesonet FrontEnd developer task

## Basic instructions

- Installation `npm i --save`
- Run local dev server `npm start`
- Run tests `npm test`
- Build production `npm run build`

## Comments

- In some place using "flexbox" in some not, just to show more options.
- App was designed like full scale production app with dashboard pages and home landing page. Since only two pages are built, urls '/' and '/dashboard' are redirecting to appropriate pages.
- There is no user validation API endpoint, instead using get servers list url to validate user's token.
- The reason I'm not using eslint here, because my local IDE has builtin eslinter, otherwise definitely use it.
- I know, I know could be more testing scenarios 🙃.

Thank you guys for this opportunity, cheers! 🍻

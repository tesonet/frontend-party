## What didn't do and why?
1. Test, Implemented one test, but it doensn't work properly. Didn't used testing before, will learn it in future. Now skipped this step for time saving.
2. Didnt used redux - because wanted to create more effective app, without redux complications. Not needed for such small app. But i know how to use redux. If needed i could implement it. You didn't mentioned it anyway :D.

# `tesonet-task` â€” Igne's implementation of the tesonet task

what it does: 

## Getting Started


### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`

### Run the Application


```
grunt serve
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:9000`]


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  view2/                --> the view2 view template and logic
    view2.html            --> the partial template
    view2.js              --> the controller logic
    view2_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the `tesonetApp` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The `tesonetApp` app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine],
which we run with the [Karma][karma] test runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* The configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`.
* The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an `_test.js` suffix (e.g.
  `view1_test.js`).

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

The `angular-seed` app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* The configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.
* The end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`.

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can
interact with it.

**Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run:**

```
npm start
```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver, we need to ensure that it is installed and
up-to-date. The `angular-seed` project is configured to do this automatically before running the
end-to-end tests, so you don't need to worry about it. If you want to manually update the WebDriver,
you can run:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running, you
can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.

**Note:**
Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires
the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
`java -version` from the command line.

If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].

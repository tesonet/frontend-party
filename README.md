## Comments about task
Used technology: React, redux, sass, webpack.

Everything's according to designs/task, only added sorting for list by server name/distance 
(clickable arrow icons). Added because in the beggining I was not sure about the part `Order the results of servers list by distance and name.`
so decided that it'll do no harm to implement sorting.

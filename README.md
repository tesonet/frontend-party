# Tesonet FrontEnd developer task

### Juozas Masiliunas

### Design

Used styled components + styled system

### App

- ES6 + Typescript + Babel 7 (new typescript loader)
- Used redux and redux saga to make it more difficult :)
- Used react router dom
- Used react new features like hooks
- Implemented axios requests to servers
- Using browser token and made middleware to check if token exist.
- Ordered server list by `distance` and `name`.
- Implemented logout
- IE 11 + supported

### Bonus

- Used webpack from scratch, also configured prettier and eslint.
- Implemented test but tested only one thing. Not very TDD developer yet :/
- Login validation also implemented + error messages.
- Where is redux actions to indicate what is loading, but didnt implemented spinner.

### Summary

- Was great party. Many technologies was chosen to make a challenge form me. I have chosen to go out from comfort zone and use technologies like redux-saga, styled-system, styled-components, typescript, configure webpack, eslint and etc.

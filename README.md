# Lead frontend developer task

I know that you are working with ReactJS, but I chose to make this task with AngularJS because it took me less time because I'm working with currently. I hope that won't be a problem. I've worked with ReactJS previously, so it wouldn't be a big deal to write code with it. 

`npm i` - to install all dependencies.

`gulp build` - to build bundle to `./dist` folder.

`gulp serve` - launches webpack server with bundle.
